      height="200" align="left">flower, the characteristic reproductive structure of angiosperms. As popularly <br>
       used, the term “flower” especially applies when part or all of the reproductive <br>
        structure is distinctive in colour and form. <br>
      petuniaPink variegated flowers of a common garden petunia
      <br> (Petunia ×atkinsiana). <br>
      lilacCommon lilac (Syringa vulgaris). <br>
      In their range of colour, size, form, and anatomical arrangement, flowers present a <br>
      seemingly endless variety of combinations. They range in size from minute blossoms to giant <br>
       blooms. In some plants, such as poppy, magnolia, tulip, and petunia, each flower is relatively  <br>
       large and showy and is produced singly, while in other plants, such as aster, snapdragon, and lilac,  <br>
       the individual flowers may be very small and are borne in a distinctive cluster known as an inflorescence. <br>
        Regardless of their variety, all flowers have a uniform function, the reproduction of the species through the <br>
         production of seed. <br>

         <p> Flowers have long been a symbol of beauty and love, but did you know that they  <br>
         also have their own language? The language of flowers, also known as floriography, is <br>
         the art of communicating sentiments and emotions through the selection and arrangement <br>
          of blooms. This ancient tradition dates back centuries and has been used by various cultures <br>
          around the world to express feelings that cannot be put into words. <br></p>

         Each flower carries its own unique meaning, therefore allowing individuals <br>
          to convey specific messages without saying a single word. For example, a red rose <br>
           signifies passionate love, while a yellow rose represents friendship. Similarly, a white <br>
           lily is associated with purity and innocence, while a violet embodies faithfulness. By <br>
            understanding the significance behind different flowers, one can create a perfectly tailored <br>
             bouquet that conveys exactly what they want to express <br></p>
